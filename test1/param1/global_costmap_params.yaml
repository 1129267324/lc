# 2 地图更新频率
# The frequency in Hz for the map to be updated.(double, default: 5.0)

# The frequency in Hz for the map to be publish display information.(double, default: 0.0)

#4 机器人本体坐标系
# The name of the frame for the base link of the robot.(string, default: "base_link")
robot_base_frame: base_link
#5 指定转换(tf)数据可容忍的延迟(以秒为单位)。这个参数可以作为一种保护措施，防止在tf树中丢失一个链接，同时仍然允许在系统中存在用户能够接受的延迟量。例如，一个转换过期0.2秒可以接受，但是一个转换过期8秒就不能接受了。如果global_frame和robot_base_frame参数指定的坐标帧之间的tf转换比ros::Time::now()早几秒，那么导航堆栈将停止机器人。(双,默认值:0.2)
# Specifies the delay in transform (tf) data that is tolerable in seconds. This parameter serves as a safeguard to losing a link in the tf tree while still allowing an amount of latency the user is comfortable with to exist in the system. For example, a transform being 0.2 seconds out-of-date may be tolerable, but a transform being 8 seconds out of date is not. If the tf transform between the coordinate frames specified by the global_frame and robot_base_frame parameters is transform_tolerance seconds older than ros::Time::now(), then the navigation stack will stop the robot.(double, default: 0.2)
transform_tolerance: 0.5
#6 地图的分辨率，单位为米/单元。(双,默认值:0.05)
# The resolution of the map in meters/cell. (double, default: 0.05)
resolution: 0.05

static_layer:

# The threshold value at which to consider a cost lethal when reading in a map from the map server.(int, default: 100)

inflation_layer:
# The radius in meters to which the map inflates obstacle cost values. (double, default: 0.55)
  inflation_radius: 0.50

# A scaling factor to apply to cost values during inflation. The cost function is computed as follows for all cells in the costmap further than the inscribed radius distance and closer than the inflation radius distance away from an actual obstacle: exp(-1.0 * cost_scaling_factor * (distance_from_obstacle - inscribed_radius)) * (costmap_2d::INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLE - 1), where costmap_2d::INSCRIBED_INFLATED_OBSTACLE is currently 254. NOTE: since the cost_scaling_factor is multiplied by a negative in the formula, increasing the factor will decrease the resulting cost values. (double, default: 10.0)
  cost_scaling_factor: 10.0

It should be set to a value that is slightly more permissive than the actual rate of the sensor.
